# Hangman Game

This is a simple Hangman game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Rules
- The game will prompt you to enter a word.
- Once you enter the word, the game will display a set of dashes representing the letters of the word.
- You can guess letters by clicking on the virtual keyboard displayed on the screen.
- If the guessed letter is correct, the corresponding dashes will be replaced with the letter in the word.
- If the guessed letter is incorrect, a hangman body part will be drawn on the canvas.
- You have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the hangman is complete.
- If you correctly guess all the letters in the word, you win the game.
- If you run out of incorrect guesses before guessing the word, you lose the game.
